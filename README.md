# Psychic-Game

About

     This game was built using JavaScript.

Instructions

     The app randomly picks a letter and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. 
        
     The user has 9 chances to pick the correct letter. So the user can track their progress, the app 
     will collect and display the number of remaining guesses and the letters that the user tried. 
        
     If the user picks the correct letter, the user wins and their win score goes up by one. 
     If the user is unable to select the correct letter, they lose. 
        
     If the user either wins or loses, they can try again and the app will keep track of
     all the times they won or lost.
